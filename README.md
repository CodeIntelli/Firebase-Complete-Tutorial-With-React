# Firebase Complete Tutorial With React
## Firebase Tutorial
- Firebase is a Backend-as-a-Service, and it is a real-time database which is basically designed for mobile applications. This tutorial is designed in such a way that we can easily understand or can perform the service of Firebase in a very efficient way.

- In the era of rapid prototyping, we can get bright ideas, but sometimes they are not applicable if they take too much work. Often, the back-end is the limiting factor - many considerations never apply to server-side coding due to lack of knowledge or time.

- Firebase is a Backend-as-a-Service(BaaS) which started as a YC11 startup. It grew up into a next-generation app-development platform on Google Cloud Platform. Firebase (a NoSQLjSON database) is a real-time database that allows storing a list of objects in the form of a tree. We can synchronize data between different devices.


## Prerequisite
- Firebase can be used for Android, iOS, Web, or Unity. In this tutorial, we perform Firebase services for Android. So, it is essential to have basic knowledge of Android Studio. A good understanding of basic JAVA and XML is required that allows us to understand the concept of Firebase better.

## Why use Firebase?
- Firebase manages real-time data in the database. So, it easily and quickly exchanges the data to and from the database. Hence, for developing mobile apps such as live streaming, chat messaging, etc., we can use Firebase.

- Firebase allows syncing real-time data across all devices - iOS, Android, and Web - without refreshing the screen.

- Firebase provides integration to Google Advertising, AdMob, Data Studio, BigQuery DoubleClick, Play Store, and Slack to develop our apps with efficient and accurate management and maintenance.
- Everything from databases, analytics to crash reports are included in Firebase. So, the app development team can stay focused on improving the user experience.
- Firebase applications can be deployed over a secured connection to the firebase server.
- Firebase offers a simple control dashboard.
- It offers a number of useful services to choose from.

## Pros and Cons of Firebase
Firebase has a lot of pros or advantages. Apart from the advantages, it has disadvantages too. Let's take a look at these advantages and disadvantages:

### Pros
- Firebase is a real-time database.
- It has massive storage size potential.
- Firebase is serverless.
- It is highly secure.
- It is the most advanced hosted BaaS solution.
- It has minimal setup.
- It provides three-way data binding via angular fire.
- It provides simple serialization of app state.
- We can easily access data, files, auth, and more.
- There is no server infrastructure required to power apps with data.
It has JSON storage, which means no barrier between data and objects.

### Cons
- Firebase is not widely used, or battle-tested for enterprises.
- It has very limited querying and indexing.
- It provides no aggregation.
- It has no map-reduce functionality.
- It cannot query or list users or stored files.
